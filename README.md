Tools for Space Engineers

How to use the Sandbox cleaner:

1. Go in target folder and you will find the zip se_tools.
2. Extract the zip and go to the bin folder.
3. To clean the Sandbox.sbc execute sandboxcleaner.bat (windows) or sandboxcleaner (linux) passing your Space Engineers save folder path to the executable

After the execution it will create two files named Sandbox.sbc.cleaned_[DATE] (the new one) and Sandbox.sbc.bak (the original one); replace your Sandbox.sbc with the cleaned version and that's it.
